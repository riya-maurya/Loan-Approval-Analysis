# Loan Approval Analysis 

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing loan approval data using data science techniques. The goal is to preprocess, analyze, and predict loan approvals based on historical data and machine learning models, specifically using the Decision Tree algorithm.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distribution, correlations, and key insights.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Decision Tree Model:** Implementing a Decision Tree classifier for loan approval prediction.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for Decision Tree implementation)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Decision_Tree.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess and analyze the loan approval data using the Decision Tree model.

## Dataset
- The project uses a dataset containing historical loan application details.
- Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory before running the notebook.

## Results
- The analysis provides insights into factors affecting loan approvals.
- The Decision Tree model predicts loan approval probabilities.
- Visualizations highlight key trends in the data.
